* Backup With ~rsync~

  Does what it says. Useful for frequent syncing between two devices with
  similar directory hierarchies. I use it for daily copying (over ssh) between
  one laptop (desktop replacement at home) to the other (more portable laptop).

** Why?

   ~rsync~ has a lot of switches, and it's exhausting to loop over them with say
   ~--delete~ flag for certain directories and not for others. With this script
   one can specify all that in a configuration file and just sync whenever you
   want.

* Features
  - ~yaml~ configuration to specify directories and flags
  - Overriding arguments supported at command line.
  - Sensible ~rsync~ defaults

* Example configuration

  #+begin_src yaml
    host:
      user@portable
    root:
      /home/user
    supported_dirs:
      Documents:
        delete: false
      Downloads:
        delete: false
      Mail:
        delete: true
      Videos:
        delete: true

  #+end_src
